      "contents": "\nInterests\n My interest in water resources management developed from a Quaker studies class I took during my final semester of college, which focused on community service and social responsibility. The course challenged me to incorporate service into my daily life by pursuing a career at the intersection of a community need and my interests and skills. During my time in college, California’s record drought followed by the wettest year in decades highlighted the need for sustainable water management. Against this backdrop, a career in sustainable water management seemed like a natural fit for my scientific training, interest in environmental science, and abiding love for California.\nI am interested in identifying intersections between water management challenges and finding solutions that address multiple issues at once. Building on the concepts I have learned through my river restoration experience, I am particularly interested in using California’s natural water infrastructure, such as groundwater reservoirs, floodplains, and forests, as intersectional solutions to water management challenges. For example, increasing the recharge of groundwater reservoirs addresses California’s growing need for water storage as well as groundwater overdraft. Expanding and restoring floodplains improves flood protection for local communities while also improving water quality and providing valuable habitat for fish and wildlife. Nature-based solutions tend to be cost-efficient and have the potential to increase the resiliency of California’s water system, while providing multiple benefits to local communities.\n\n\n\n",
